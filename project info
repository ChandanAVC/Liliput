As per the task we built a Forum from the scratch using php .
Forum is basically a discussion platform where anyone can start there discussion within a category and te questions in the category are considered to be threads . 
And the replies keeps on adding as threads. 
We have some of the categories to start with.
In each of these categories ,an user can add his own topic and can ask for queries and can get instant replies !
We have a registration process for our forum using captcha and formal email verification process!
Captcha , as u all know that hackers will be waiting to fill your Database with random contents by scripting , so inorder to avoid that we have interoduced captcha!
A user can register with a faka mail id to trouble anyone!
So we built a email verification procedure to serve our forum users better!

Every topic dont need a discussion , so we build a form for submission of blog posts! Where people can get to know about the various topics they are interested in nd they can evn contribute for this with their 
posts!


Every registered user have their personalised user profile giving details about them!with profile picture ,status and personal info!

We even have a Image and a Video Gallery ! where in Image gallery users can upload the pics and display it to all users on the forum.
We even have a video gallery ! where we are saving server space by linking it to youtube's video!
Where they just need to put up the Embed link of Youtube's video.

You can have a page to list the number of users of the forum.

You can have a private chat ,where you can text an user into his inbox. 

You can get an opyion to take login to our forum via Facebook and Twitter.

We even have an option to share each post onto many social sites,almost 300.

You can even share the post on Whatsapp, Facebook and many more sites.
